This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, to predict the price of a car based on various features such as brand, fuel type, age, mileage, and more. 
The model is built using Python and scikit-learn and provides predictions for car prices based on user input.

## Features include-
Linear Regression Model: The core of the model, trained to predict car prices based on historical data.<br>
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling data for better model performance.<br>
User Input Interface: Built a GUI using Tkinter to allow users to input car details and get real-time price predictions.<br>
Accuracy: The model has been trained and evaluated with real-world data for optimal accuracy.

## Technologies Used-
Python<br>
scikit-learn (for machine learning)<br>
Tkinter (for GUI development)<br>
Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)<br>
Matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Setup Instructions-
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/suchika01raturi/car-price-predictor.git

2) Install the necessary dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

3) Run the Jupyter Notebook to start the prediction model.
python car_price_predictor.py

4) Use the Tkinter GUI to input car details and get the predicted price.

## Project Structure-
car_price_predictor.py: Main script containing the model and GUI.<br>
car data.csv: Dataset used for training the model.<br>
README.md: This file.
